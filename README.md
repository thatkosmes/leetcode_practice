# LeetCode Practice Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode practice repository**!  

In this repository, I keep the problems I have solved from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), along with my personal solutions and explanations.

---

## Repository Structure

I have organized the problems into two main folders:

1. **`sql/`** – contains problems related to **SQL**.  
2. **`algorithms/`** – contains problems related to **algorithms** and **data structures**.

## How Each Problem is Organized

For every problem, there is a **separate folder** named with the problem ID and title (for example: `620_not_boring_movies`). Each problem folder typically contains:

- `solution.py` or `solution.sql` – the file with my working solution.  
- `README.md` – a description of the problem, including:
  - problem statement  
  - intuition or approach to solving the problem  
  - explanation of the solution logic  
  - optional notes on **time and space complexity**  

This structure helps me keep track of my progress and allows others to understand not only the solution but also the thought process behind it.

## Goals

- Maintain a personal record of **LeetCode problem-solving progress**.  
- Provide clear **explanations and reasoning** for each solution.  
- Track improvements in **problem-solving skills**, including SQL, algorithms, and data structures.
